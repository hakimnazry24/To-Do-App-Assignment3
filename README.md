# To-Do App Project Overview

## Current State of the To-Do App

So far, I've built a pretty standard To-Do List application. It lets users:

* **Create** new tasks: Add whatever they need to get done to their list.
* **Retrieve** (Read) tasks: See all their existing tasks.
* **Update** tasks: Mark tasks as complete or edit their descriptions.
* **Delete** tasks: Remove tasks they've finished or no longer need.

## Enhancements: Making it Secure and Smart!
### 1. User Authentication (Login Page)

The first big step is to add a proper login system. Right now, anyone can use it. But soon:

* Users will need to **register** and then **log in** with a username (or email) and password.
* After successfully logging in, they'll be **redirected** to their personalized To-Do list page. This means their tasks will be private and secure!

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

This is where it gets really interesting! I'm adding an RBAC system to differentiate between regular users and administrators:

* **Registered Users:** These are the standard users who will go directly to their To-Do list page (where they can do their usual CRUD operations on *their own* tasks).
* **Administrators:** These special users will be redirected to an entirely separate **administration page**. This page will give them powerful control over the application's users and their data.

### 3. New Data Structures for Roles and Permissions

To make RBAC work, I'm introducing two new collections (think of them as tables in a database):

* **`UserRoles` Collection:** This will link users to their specific roles. It will contain:
    * `RoleID`: A unique identifier for the role assignment.
    * `UserID`: The ID of the user this role applies to.
    * `RoleName`: The name of the role (e.g., "User", "Administrator").
    * `Description`: A brief explanation of what this role entails.

* **`RolePermissions` Collection:** This will define what each role is allowed to do (e.g., if a role can create, retrieve, update, or delete tasks). It will contain:
    * `PermissionID`: A unique identifier for the permission.
    * `RoleID`: The ID of the role this permission belongs to.
    * `Description`: What the permission allows (e.g., "Create Task", "Retrieve User List", "Delete User").

### 4. Administrator Privileges

The administration page will be a central hub for managing the app's users. Administrators will be able to:

* See a **list of all registered users**.
* **Delete** user accounts.
* **Activate and Deactivate** user accounts (if someone needs a temporary block).
* **View** the To-Do tasks created by *each* user from the user list.
* **Manage user permissions** on CRUD operations, meaning they could potentially assign or revoke abilities for other users.

### 5. `RoleMiddleware` Function

Finally, I'll be creating a special function, kind of like a security guard, called `RoleMiddleware`. This function will:

* **Check a user's role and permissions** every time they try to access a specific part of the application.
* It will make sure that only authorized users (based on their role and permissions) can access certain features or pages. This helps keep everything secure and organized.

This project is shaping up to be much more than just a simple To-Do list, and I'm excited to get these new features implemented!
